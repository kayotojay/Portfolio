No one had knowledge of where they came from or how they came to be. Many had lost memories of their lives in the past world. Not a soul could recall his or her own name, more less the names of people that they could remember. The most people could recall was common knowledge of the world before. I was 9 when I awakened in this new world, I was on a small island with around a thousand people. Most had only focused on their own survival. Within the first day 5 people had died. Strange creatures had resided on the island. Too animal looking to be called monsters. Their appearance suited the odd terrain, so nowhere close to being alien. One of these creatures had resembled a wolf with a mix of bison and deer.
